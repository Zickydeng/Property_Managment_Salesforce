# *Property Management App*

This is a Salesforce property management Salesforce application that allows you to post available properties for rent or sublease. After you have advertised your home, the management will mail you an invoice along with the minimum agreement paperwork. You may also pay your invoices entirely within the app, which includes payment verification using the authorized.net api. The APP is integrated with Authorized.net to verify credit card payment.
